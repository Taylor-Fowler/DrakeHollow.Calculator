### game-data.json notes
#### Level 5 
- Additional Experience and Cumulative Experience are estimated as I did not have a save at level 4.

#### Massage Bed
- Mentions providing entertainment in the description, however, I did not notice a change in entertainment production with it built. But could be that I just didn't give it long enough?

#### Heat Providers
- At current writing, heat production is not taken into consideration as there isnt an accurate way of measuring the occupied space for each building. I have still added the heat utility to the buildings with a random radius guess.
